# Restaurant Menu HTML Project Submission

## Project Title
**Restaurant Menu Web Page**  

## Description
This project is a fully structured HTML page representing a restaurant menu with an order form. It demonstrates my understanding of HTML5 semantics, forms, and content structuring. Key features include:

- **Header Section**
  - Restaurant logo image with `id="header-img"`.
  - `<h1>` heading for the restaurant name.
  - Navigation with links to `#menu` and `#order-form`.

- **Main Section**
  - **Menu Section**
    - At least three menu items, each in an `<article>` element.
    - Each `<article>` includes:
      - An `<img>` element.
      - A `<h3>` title element.
      - A `<p>` description with price in `<em>` (italicized).
  - **Order Form Section**
    - `<form>` element for placing orders.
    - Number inputs for menu items (with minimum validation of 0).
    - Radio or checkbox inputs for sides and add-ons.
    - A `<textarea>` for special requests.
    - Submit button labeled "Go To Checkout".
    - Proper `<label>` elements for all inputs.

- **Footer Section**
  - Paragraph stating: "Made with love by [Your Codédex Username]".

## Purpose
The project showcases my ability to:
- Structure a webpage using HTML5 semantic elements.
- Implement forms with proper input validation.
- Combine content presentation with interactivity (ordering system).

## How to View
1. Open `restaurant_menu.html` in a web browser.
2. Navigate through the menu and try the order form.
3. Inspect the HTML structure for semantic correctness.

## Request
I am submitting this project to request my **HTML Certificate** from Codédex. This page demonstrates my knowledge of HTML, forms, and proper content structuring.
